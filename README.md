The Fox and the Hound Game
The fox and the hound game is based on the childhood game of tic tac toe or naughts and crosses where two people select a square each to try and get three images in a row.

Getting Started

All you need is a browser to run the game in. Chrome works best.

Running the tests

The game essentially has 3 outcomes, the fox or the hound wins by getting three images in a row or the 3rd outcome is its a draw. All three outcomes have a notice advising you who has one or if its a draw.
